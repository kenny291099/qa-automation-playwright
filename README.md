> **Note**: The current implementation includes a complete example using Sauce Demo e-commerce site. This serves as a reference implementation that can be easily adapted for other web applications by creating new page objects and updating the configuration.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the test automation framework:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kenny291099/qa-automation-playwright.git
cd qa-automation-playwright
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Download and install all Maven dependencies
mvn clean compile
```

### 3. Install Playwright Browsers

```bash
# Download browser binaries for cross-browser testing
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.microsoft.playwright.CLI" -Dexec.args="install"
```

This command downloads Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit browsers for test execution.

### 4. Execute Tests

```bash
# Run complete test suite
mvn test

# Run specific test class
mvn test -Dtest=LoginTest

# Execute tests with different browsers
mvn test -Dbrowser=firefox

# Run tests in headed mode for visual debugging
mvn test -Dheadless=false

# Execute with slow motion for demonstration purposes
mvn test -Dbrowser=webkit -Dheadless=false -Dslow.mo=1000
```

The slow motion option is particularly useful for debugging and demonstration scenarios.

## Test Reporting & Analytics

The framework generates comprehensive test reports using the Allure Framework:

```bash
# Generate detailed test report
mvn allure:report

# Serve report with live browser preview
mvn allure:serve
```

### Report Features

- **Comprehensive Test Results** - Detailed pass/fail status with execution metrics
- **Failure Documentation** - Automatic screenshot capture for failed test scenarios
- **Video Recording** - Complete browser session recordings for complex workflows
- **Debug Traces** - Playwright's advanced debugging traces for step-by-step analysis
- **Execution Details** - Granular step-by-step test execution logging
- **Environment Information** - Complete test environment metadata and configuration
- **Historical Trends** - Test execution trends and performance metrics over time
- **Test Categories** - Organized test results by features, epics, and stories

The Allure server automatically opens the report in your default browser, typically at `http://localhost:[auto-assigned-port]`.

## Configuration

### Test Configuration (`src/test/resources/config.properties`)

```properties
# Application settings
base.url=https://www.saucedemo.com  # Update this URL for your target application
browser=chromium                    # chromium, firefox, webkit
headless=true                      # true/false
slow.mo=0                          # Slow motion in milliseconds

# Timeouts
timeout=30000                      # Default timeout in milliseconds

# Recording settings
video.mode=ON_FAILURE              # OFF, ON_FAILURE, ALWAYS
screenshot.mode=ON_FAILURE         # OFF, ON_FAILURE, ALWAYS
trace.mode=ON_FAILURE              # OFF, ON_FAILURE, ALWAYS

# Execution settings
parallel.workers=1                 # Number of parallel workers
retry.count=1                      # Number of retries for failed tests
```

> **Adapting for Different Applications**: Simply update the `base.url` property to point to your target web application. You may also need to create new page objects in the `pages` package that correspond to your application's structure.

### System Properties Override

You can override configuration using system properties:

```bash
mvn test -Dbrowser=firefox -Dheadless=false -Dtimeout=60000
```

## Test Coverage & Scenarios

- **Matrix Testing**: Supports running tests across Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit
- **Parallel Execution**: Tests can run in parallel across different browsers
- **Artifact Collection**: Automated collection of screenshots, videos, traces, and logs
- **Report Generation**: Automated Allure report generation and publishing
- **Flexible Configuration**: Support for different environments and test suites

### Other CI/CD Platforms
The framework works with any CI/CD platform that supports Maven and Java:
- **Jenkins**: Use Jenkinsfile with Maven commands
- **GitLab CI**: Configure `.gitlab-ci.yml` with test stages
- **Azure DevOps**: Setup build pipelines with Maven tasks
- **CircleCI**: Configure `.circleci/config.yml` for test execution

### Sample CI Configuration
```bash
# Example CI commands
mvn clean test -Dbrowser=chromium -Dheadless=true
mvn allure:report
# Publish artifacts: test-results/, target/site/allure-maven-plugin/
```

## 📁 Test Artifacts

Test execution generates the following artifacts:

```
test-results/
├── screenshots/          # Screenshots on failures
├── videos/              # Screen recordings (if enabled)
└── traces/              # Playwright traces for debugging

logs/
└── test.log             # Application logs

target/
├── allure-results/      # Raw Allure test results
└── site/allure-maven-plugin/  # Generated Allure reports
```

## Development & Customization

### Adapting for Your Application

1. **Update Configuration**: Modify `config.properties` with your application's base URL
2. **Create New Page Objects**: Model your application's pages in the `pages` package
3. **Update Package Names**: Rename `com.saucedemo` to reflect your project/company
4. **Write Application-Specific Tests**: Create test classes that match your user workflows

### Adding New Tests

1. Create new test class extending `BaseTest`
2. Use Page Objects from your application's pages package
3. Add Allure annotations (`@Epic`, `@Feature`, `@Story`) for better reporting
4. Follow the existing naming conventions and patterns

### Creating New Page Objects

1. Extend `BasePage` class for common functionality
2. Define locators as private final fields using Playwright selectors
3. Implement page-specific methods with `@Step` annotations for Allure
4. Return appropriate page objects for method chaining and fluent API
5. Use descriptive method names that reflect business actions

### Framework Best Practices

- **Page Object Model**: Keep test logic separate from page interactions
- **Allure Annotations**: Use `@Step`, `@Epic`, `@Feature`, `@Story` for comprehensive reporting
- **Assertions**: Use descriptive assertion messages for easier debugging
- **Logging**: Add appropriate logging for test execution visibility
- **Wait Strategies**: Use Playwright's built-in waits instead of hard sleeps
- **Test Data**: Externalize test data using properties files or data providers
- **Maintainability**: Keep tests simple, focused, and independent

### Example Page Object Structure
```java
public class YourApplicationPage extends BasePage {
    private final String pageTitle = "h1[data-test='page-title']";
    private final String submitButton = "button[type='submit']";
    
    @Step("Verify page is loaded")
    public YourApplicationPage verifyPageLoaded() {
        assertThat(page.locator(pageTitle)).isVisible();
        return this;
    }
    
    @Step("Click submit button")
    public NextPage clickSubmit() {
        page.locator(submitButton).click();
        return new NextPage(page);
    }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Playwright browsers not installed**
   ```bash
   mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.microsoft.playwright.CLI" -Dexec.args="install"
   ```

2. **Tests failing in headless mode**
   ```bash
   mvn test -Dheadless=false
   ```

3. **Slow test execution**
   ```bash
   mvn test -Dslow.mo=1000  # Add 1 second delay between actions
   ```

4. **Port conflicts**
   ```bash
   mvn allure:serve -Dallure.serve.port=8080
   ```

### Debug Mode

Enable debug mode for detailed execution traces:

```bash
mvn test -Dtrace.mode=ALWAYS -Dvideo.mode=ALWAYS -Dheadless=false
```
